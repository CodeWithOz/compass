# Motivation & Guiding Principles

## Why This Exists

Important work becomes invisible without structure, and structure becomes brittle when it ignores human variability.

The user is:
- Temporarily unemployed
- Preparing for a high-stakes French exam
- Running a self-directed career exploration sabbatical
- Building professional visibility without forcing artificial output

The system should:
- Preserve momentum under constraint
- Surface meaningful signals instead of vanity metrics
- Make reflection cheap and automatic
- Allow graceful adjustment without system collapse

## Core Principles

1. Systems over willpower
2. Momentum beats precision
3. Reflection is the product
4. Exit is a feature
5. Zero paid SaaS
