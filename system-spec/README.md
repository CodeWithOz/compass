# Personal Resolution Tracking & Reflection System

This project defines a lightweight, self-hosted system for tracking daily effort, momentum, and insights across a small number of high-leverage life resolutions.

The goal is not productivity theater or habit gamification.
The goal is clarity, momentum, and honest feedback over time.

This document set is intended to be handed directly to a developer.
